# Polydat Type System

The static `PortType` contract on wires, its runtime
`Value` representation, and the adapter catalog that
moves values between types.

Implementation: `polydat/src/ast.rs` (`PortType`,
`Value`), `polydat/src/library/convert.rs` (adapter
nodes), `polydat/src/compile/assembly.rs::auto_adapter`
(catalog dispatch), `polydat/src/kernel/state.rs::adapt_boundary_value`
(boundary application).

## 1. PortType — the static wire contract

`PortType` is the type a wire carries from producer to
consumer. Every `Port` (input or output) on every node
declares one. The assembler validates that producer
and consumer agree, inserting auto-adapter nodes from
the catalog where it can heal a mismatch.

| Variant | Width | Storage at runtime | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `U64`     | 64-bit unsigned | `Value::U64(u64)` | Workhorse: hash outputs, counters, primary keys |
| `I64`     | 64-bit signed   | `Value::I64(i64)` | **Honest signed carrier** (alignment §5) — display/JSON render negatives correctly |
| `U32`/`U16`/`U8` | narrow unsigned | `Value::U64` (zero-extended) | Widen to `U64` automatically |
| `I32`/`I16`/`I8` | narrow signed | `Value::I64` (sign-extended) | Widen to `I64` automatically |
| `F64`     | 64-bit float    | `Value::F64(f64)` | IEEE 754 double |
| `F32`     | 32-bit float    | `Value::U64` (as `f32::to_bits() as u64`) | Bit-stuffed; widens to `F64` |
| `F16`     | 16-bit float    | `Value::U64` (as `f16::to_bits() as u64`) | binary16; widens exactly to F32/F64 |
| `U128`/`I128` | 128-bit int | `Value::U128`/`I128(Bits128)` | Two u64 limbs (keeps `Value` at align 8); interpreter-only |
| `Reg128`, `RegI8x16`, `RegI16x8`, `RegI32x4`, `RegI64x2`, `RegF16x8`, `RegF32x4`, `RegF64x2` | 128-bit SIMD word | `Value::Reg128(Bits128, RegLanes)` | One register word under 8 lane-views; reg→reg is a free bitcast retag (alignment §8.4) |
| `Bool`    | logical          | `Value::Bool(bool)` | Distinct runtime variant |
| `Str`     | UTF-8 string     | `Value::Str(Arc<str>)` | Cheap-clone via Arc |
| `Bytes`   | raw bytes        | `Value::Bytes(Arc<[u8]>)` | Cheap-clone via Arc |
| `Json`    | serde_json Value | `Value::Json(Arc<serde_json::Value>)` | Cheap-clone via Arc |
| `Ext`     | adapter-contributed | `Value::Ext(Box<dyn ReflectedValue>)` | UUIDs, timestamps, IPs |
| `Handle`  | type-erased Arc  | `Value::Handle(Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>)` | Datasets, prepared stmts |
| `VecF32`/`VecF64`/`VecF16` | float lanes | `Value::Vec*(SliceArc<T>)` | Typed slices; native CQL vector binding |
| `VecI8`/`VecI16`/`VecI32`/`VecI64` | int lanes | `Value::Vec*(SliceArc<T>)` | Complete cranelift lane family (alignment §8.2) |

The scalar-width set is the full cranelift scalar vocabulary
(every integer width in both signednesses, f16/f32/f64) minus
F128, which stable Rust cannot carry; the vector element set is
every cranelift lane type with a JSON Number projection. See
`type_system_alignment.md` for the derivation and §8 for the
full-scope model.

**Four storage classes** group the variants by how the runtime
carries them:

- **Single-word scalars** (`U8`–`U64`, `I8`–`I64`,
  `F16`/`F32`/`F64`, `Bool`) — one machine word per value, in three
  carriers (`Value::U64`, `Value::I64`, `Value::F64`) plus
  `Value::Bool`; the wide types ride their carrier natively, the
  narrow widths are *bit-stuffed* into it (the `PortType` says how
  to read the bits). JIT-eligible at P3.
- **Two-limb 128-bit** (`U128`, `I128`) — `Bits128([u64; 2])`;
  interpreter-only until the two-slot JIT ABI lands.
- **128-bit SIMD register plane** (`Reg128` + 7 lane-views) — a
  16-byte word with a `RegLanes` view tag; reg→reg retags are free
  bitcasts and the arithmetic ops JIT to native SIMD.
- **Arc-backed handles** (`Str`, `Bytes`, `Json`, the `Vec*` lane
  family, `Handle`, and the boxed `Ext`) — clone is one atomic
  refcount bump; consumer fibers share one allocation.

Each family is detailed below. The static slot's declared
`PortType` is always the canonical contract; the runtime [`Value`]
variant (§2) is its storage realisation.

### 1.1 Integer widths — `U8`/`U16`/`U32`/`U64`, `I8`/`I16`/`I32`/`I64`

The integer vocabulary is every cranelift scalar width in both
signednesses. At runtime **all unsigned widths share `Value::U64`**
(zero-extended into the low bits) and **all signed widths share
`Value::I64`** (sign-extended) — the *honest signed carrier*
(alignment §5): a negative `I32` is stored as a negative `i64`, so
its display and JSON projection render `-1`, not `4294967295`. The
`PortType` is the sole record of the declared width; the carrier
only knows "u-bits" or "s-bits".

- **Storage cost** — one `u64` slot regardless of width. There is
  no `Value::U8`; an `U8` wire is a `Value::U64` whose producer
  promises the high 56 bits are zero.
- **JIT (P3)** — the single-slot stuffing is what makes narrow
  widths free to compile: widen is `uextend`/`sextend`, narrow is a
  mask, all on the one `compiled_u64` register. No boxing.
- **Conversions** — widening (`u8 → u64`, `u32 → i64`, …) is class A
  and auto-inserted; narrowing is class B (range-checked, boundary
  only). See §3.
- **Use** — `U64` is the workhorse (hashes, counters, keys); the
  narrow widths exist so a node can declare the *real* column width
  (CQL `tinyint`/`smallint`/`int`) and bind it natively without a
  widening detour.

### 1.2 128-bit integers — `U128` / `I128`

The cranelift `I128` lane under both signedness readings. Unlike
the ≤64-bit widths, a 128-bit value cannot ride a single `u64`
slot, so it has its **own `Value` variants** (`U128`, `I128`),
each carrying a [`Bits128`] — two little-endian `u64` limbs
(`[lo, hi]`). Storing two limbs instead of a raw Rust `u128` keeps
`Value`'s alignment at 8 and its footprint inside the 40-byte
buffer-slot envelope (the `value_size_probe` test guards this).

- **Interpreter-only** — the JIT path needs a two-slot ABI that
  does not exist yet, so 128-bit ops run in the interpreter. The
  carrier reassembles to a native `u128`/`i128` in two register
  moves for the arithmetic, then re-splits.
- **JSON** — projects as a **decimal string**, not a JSON Number
  (which tops out at the `u64`/`i64`/`f64` leaves); the extractor
  also accepts an in-range Number for convenience.
- **`Bytes`** — exactly 16 little-endian bytes.
- **Conversions** — every ≤64-bit integer and `Bool` widens into
  `U128`/`I128` (class A); `→ f64` is class A; every narrowing back
  out (`→ {u8…i64, f16, f32}`) is a range-checked class-B boundary
  adapter.

### 1.3 Floats — `F16` / `F32` / `F64`

IEEE 754 binary16 / binary32 / binary64. `F64` is the primary
float and the canonical widening target. `F32` and `F16` are
**bit-stuffed**: a node that outputs `F32` stores
`f32::to_bits() as u64` in `Value::U64` (and `F16` stores its
16-bit pattern the same way), so they cost one slot and JIT like
integers. A *host-written* float slot may instead arrive as a
materialised `Value::F64`; [`Value::satisfies_slot`] accepts both
forms (§4).

- **`F128` is absent** — stable Rust has no `f128` carrier, so the
  scalar float set stops at `F64` (alignment §8.1).
- **Conversions** — `f16 → f32 → f64` widens exactly (every `f16`
  is exact in `f32`/`f64`). `int → f64` is always class A (total,
  rounds above 2⁵³); `int → f32`/`f16` is class A only when the
  integer fits the target's exact-int window (`u8`/`i8` → `f16`,
  `u8`/`u16`/`i8`/`i16` → `f32`), else class B. Float → int is
  always explicit/boundary (rounding + NaN/Inf are user choices).

### 1.4 Boolean — `Bool`

A distinct `Value::Bool(bool)` variant (not bit-stuffed) used by
conditional ops, selection nodes, and flag computation. `Bool`
widens to **every** numeric width as `1`/`0` (class A) and every
numeric reduces to `Bool` by a nonzero test (class A) — both
directions are total, so the matrix row/column for `Bool` is
almost entirely `A`.

### 1.5 SIMD register plane — `Reg128` + lane views

A `Reg128` is a **128-bit SIMD register word** carried as
`Value::Reg128(Bits128, RegLanes)`: the 16 bytes plus a
[`RegLanes`] tag recording the *current* interpretation. The seven
typed `PortType`s name a homogeneous lane reading of the same
word:

| PortType | Lanes | PortType | Lanes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RegI8x16` | `[i8; 16]` | `RegI64x2` | `[i64; 2]` |
| `RegI16x8` | `[i16; 8]` | `RegF16x8` | `[f16; 8]` |
| `RegI32x4` | `[i32; 4]` | `RegF32x4` | `[f32; 4]` |
| `Reg128` (`Raw`) | algorithm-defined bytes | `RegF64x2` | `[f64; 2]` |

- **Views are free bitcasts** — every reg→reg wire is healed by
  the assembler with a [`RegView`] retag node that changes the
  `RegLanes` tag and touches **no bits** (alignment §8.4 layer 2).
  A word can be `[i64; 2]` for one op, raw bytes for a shuffle, and
  `[f32; 4]` for a dot product, at zero cost. This is the one
  family where every intra-plane conversion is class A and every
  cross-plane conversion (reg ↔ scalar/container/vec) is absent —
  a closed clique (§3).
- **Native SIMD JIT** — the element-wise ops (`add`/`sub`/`mul`
  across each lane family) and `reg_dot_f32` compile to native
  vector instructions. Integer lane arithmetic **wraps** (modular);
  range-checking belongs to the scalar adapter system, not the
  register ops.
- **Determinism** — `reg_dot_f32` uses a *fixed* reduction tree
  `((l0+l1)+(l2+l3))` so float dot products are bit-reproducible
  across machines (determinism rule D2).
- **Use** — SWAR/state-word algorithms, fixed-width SIMD kernels,
  and `reg_shuffle_bytes` (arbitrary byte permutation from a
  16-entry const mask). Nodes live in `library/register.rs`.

### 1.6 Strings, bytes, JSON — `Str` / `Bytes` / `Json`

The Arc-backed scalar containers. Each clones in one atomic
increment with no allocation:

- **`Str`** — `Arc<str>`, UTF-8. The universal sink: every numeric,
  `Bool`, and `Json` renders to `Str` via Display (class A).
  Per-cycle template interpolation pointer-shares rather than
  re-allocating.
- **`Bytes`** — `Arc<[u8]>`. Little-endian serialisation target for
  every numeric, `Bool`, and the `Vec*` lanes. `Bytes ↔ Str` is
  lowercase hex; `Bytes ↔ Json` is a hex `Json::String`. Unsigned
  byte buffers are `Bytes`, not a `Vec` lane (§3.1).
- **`Json`** — `Arc<serde_json::Value>`. Structured capture and
  result-body projection share the tree by Arc; consumers that need
  an owned tree deep-clone at the use site. Non-finite floats make
  `f64`/`f32`/`VecF32 → Json` class B (`serde_json` rejects them).

### 1.7 Typed vector lanes — `VecF32`/`VecF64`/`VecF16`, `VecI8`/`VecI16`/`VecI32`/`VecI64`

Typed slices (`Value::Vec*(SliceArc<T>)`) that flow vector data
from accessors to native-binding adapters with **no per-cycle
string-format or byte-serialise step**. The element set is every
cranelift lane type that has a JSON Number projection — completing
the lane family alongside the register plane (alignment §8.2).

- **[`SliceArc<T>`]** — a typed slice handle with two storage
  modes: *owned* (`Arc<[T]>`, one allocation) or *zero-copy* (a raw
  `(ptr, len)` borrow into a long-lived owner such as an mmap'd
  dataset, kept alive by the owner's Arc). Clone is one atomic
  increment either way (SRD 53 §"Native Vector Binding").
- **Native binding** — `VecF32`/`VecF64`/`VecF16` bind CQL
  `vector<float|double|half_float, N>`; `VecI8`/`VecI16`/`VecI32`/
  `VecI64` bind `vector<tinyint|smallint|int|bigint, N>`. The
  adapter handles dataset→column precision at bind time.
- **Catalog coverage** — all seven lanes inter-convert
  element-wise (widening lanes class A, narrowing / `float→int`
  class B, panic-on-bad-element like the scalar adapters) and each
  serialises to / parses from `Bytes` / `Json` / `Str` (§3). Only
  `Vec → scalar` is intentionally absent (no canonical reduction —
  use `vec_len` / `vec_first` / `vec_sum` / `vec_mean`).

### 1.8 Type-erased — `Ext` / `Handle`

Opaque handles the producer mints and the consumer downcasts;
never in the adapter catalog (§3).

- **`Ext`** — `Box<dyn ReflectedValue>`. Protocol-native values
  (UUIDs, timestamps, inet addresses) that flow through Polydat
  without boxing to strings. Consumers reach typed access via
  `ReflectedValue::try_as_str` / `as_json` / … at the consume site.
- **`Handle`** — `Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>`. A resolved resource
  (dataset, prepared statement); the producer node (`dataset_open`,
  …) populates it and the consumer downcasts with
  `Value::as_handle::<T>()`. One `Arc::clone` per cycle, zero
  allocation (SRD 53 §"Dataset Handles").

---

## 2. Value — the runtime representation

`Value` has fewer variants than `PortType` because
the bit-stuffed numeric forms share two storage
slots:

```rust
pub enum Value {
    U64(u64),                          // also stores U32/U16/U8 (zero-extended)
    I64(i64),                          // honest signed carrier; also I32/I16/I8 (sign-extended)
    U128(Bits128), I128(Bits128),      // two u64 limbs (align-8 envelope)
    Reg128(Bits128, RegLanes),         // 128-bit SIMD word + its current lane-view tag
    F64(f64),                          // also stores F32/F16 bits via to_bits()
    Bool(bool),
    Str(Arc<str>),
    Bytes(Arc<[u8]>),
    Json(Arc<serde_json::Value>),
    Ext(Box<dyn ReflectedValue>),
    Handle(Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>),
    VecF32(SliceArc<f32>), VecF64(SliceArc<f64>), VecF16(SliceArc<half::f16>),
    VecI8(SliceArc<i8>), VecI16(SliceArc<i16>),
    VecI32(SliceArc<i32>), VecI64(SliceArc<i64>),
    None,                              // sentinel for absent / uninit
}
```

Note the floats: an `F32`-typed *node output* carries its bit
pattern in `Value::U64` (the macro's `IntoValue for f32`), while
a host-written `F32` slot value may arrive as `Value::F64`;
`satisfies_slot` accepts both. `F16` follows the same dual
convention.

`Value::None` is the *absent* sentinel. It appears in
freshly-allocated buffer slots before first
evaluation and as the "no value yet" marker for
optional ports. Per SRD-74 it propagates through node
evaluation: any node whose inputs include `None`
emits `None` on every output unless it explicitly
opts in via `GkNode::accepts_none_inputs()`.

`Value::port_type()` reports the *runtime variant's*
PortType, which collapses the narrow widths into their
carriers — U32/U16/U8 → U64, I32/I16/I8 → I64, F32/F16
→ their stuffed carrier — (or returns `PortType::U64`
for `None` as a placeholder). The static slot's declared `PortType`
is the canonical type contract; `Value::port_type()`
is only used at boundary check sites
(`adapt_boundary_value`) to detect mismatches.

### 2.1 Carriers

Three helper types back the multi-`PortType` variants:

- **`Bits128([u64; 2])`** — little-endian limbs (`[lo, hi]`)
  behind `U128`, `I128`, and `Reg128`. The `[u64; 2]` (vs a raw
  `u128`) keeps `Value` at alignment 8 and inside the 40-byte slot
  envelope; reassembly to a native `u128`/`i128` is two register
  moves. Provides per-lane views (`lanes_i8` → `[i8; 16]`, …,
  `lanes_f16`/`f32`/`f64`) that the register plane reads.
- **`RegLanes`** — the view tag inside `Reg128`: `Raw` (algorithm-
  defined heterogeneous bytes) or one of the seven homogeneous
  readings (`I8x16` … `F64x2`). Changing the tag is a free bitcast
  (§1.5); the bytes never move.
- **`SliceArc<T>`** — the typed-slice handle behind every `Vec*`
  lane. Holds `(owner: Arc<dyn Any>, ptr, len)` so it supports both
  an owned `Arc<[T]>` and a zero-copy borrow into an mmap'd owner;
  clone is one atomic increment (§1.7).

### 2.2 The `None` sentinel

`Value::None` is the *absent* marker (it appears in
freshly-allocated buffer slots before first evaluation and as the
"no value yet" state of optional ports) — already covered above;
per SRD-74 it propagates through evaluation unless a node opts in
via `accepts_none_inputs()`. It is not a `PortType`: no wire
declares `None`, and `port_type()` reports `U64` as a placeholder.

---

## 3. Adapter catalogs

Two catalogs live in
`polydat/src/compile/assembly.rs`:

```rust
pub fn auto_adapter(from: PortType, to: PortType) -> Option<Box<dyn GkNode>>;
pub fn boundary_adapter(from: PortType, to: PortType) -> Option<Box<dyn GkNode>>;
```

- **`auto_adapter`** — intra-graph wire validation.
  Consulted by the assembler when a producer node's
  output `PortType` differs from a consumer node's
  input `PortType`. Strict: never returns an adapter
  that can panic on unparseable input. The intent is
  that any wire mismatch the catalog cannot heal is
  an author-detectable compile-time error.
- **`boundary_adapter`** — host-boundary writes via
  `adapt_boundary_value`. A strict superset of
  `auto_adapter`: delegates to it first, then adds
  boundary-only parser adapters (`Str→{Bool, U64,
  F64}`) for the workload-param flow where the
  source is intrinsically textual.

When either function returns `Some(node)`, the wire
chain inserts that adapter node. When it returns
`None`, the boundary surfaces
`WriteError::TypeMismatch` (or an assembler error at
compile time) with `from` and `to` in the
diagnostic.

The matrix below is **generated from the two catalog
functions** in `compile/assembly.rs` (the cell-level source of
truth) and covers every conversion type that has at least one
catalog entry. Cells: **A** (in `auto_adapter` — intra-graph +
boundary, never panics), **B** (in `boundary_adapter` only —
lossy/parseable/shape-checking, can panic on bad input), **·**
(no adapter — fails with `TypeMismatch`), **─** (identity).

The narrow widths (`u8`/`i8`/`u16`/`i16`/`f16`) live in
`library/polyfill_narrow.rs`, the 128-bit integers in
`library/polyfill_128.rs`, and the macro-generated
matrix-completion adapters (every remaining narrowing + the full
vector-lane family) in `library/polyfill_complete.rs`. The matrix
is **complete** — every meaningful pair has an adapter, with only
the deliberate scalar↔vector exclusion left as `·` (§3.3). The
`adapter_catalog_invariants` property test enforces both the
widening invariant and total coverage.

The grid is **complete**: every meaningful pair has an adapter.
The only `·` cells are **scalar ↔ vector**, which is intentionally
undefined — a scalar has no canonical vector length and a vector
no canonical scalar reduction (use `vec_len` / `vec_first` /
`vec_sum` / `vec_mean` for the deliberate reductions). Two type
groups carry no row or column at all (omitted from the grid):

- **Register views** (`Reg128`, `RegI8x16` … `RegF64x2`) — any
  reg→reg pair is class A via a zero-cost `RegView` retag; reg ↔
  scalar/container/vec is never in the catalog (a closed clique).
- **`Ext` / `Handle`** — never adapted; typed access happens at
  the consume site (`ReflectedValue` / `as_handle::<T>()`).

**Class A — always-defined** (lossless or fully-
defined for every valid runtime input). The
`adapter_catalog_invariants` test encodes this set as a predicate
and proves `auto_adapter` covers all of it:

- **Numeric widening** — the rule, now complete with no holes:
  unsigned → any **strictly-wider** integer of either signedness
  (`u8 → i16`, `u32 → i64`, `u16 → u128`, …); signed → any wider
  signed (`i8 → i64`, `i32 → i128`); float → wider float
  (`f16 → f32 → f64`); and `int → f64` always (the canonical float,
  total even when it rounds above 2⁵³). `int → f32`/`f16` joins
  class A exactly when the integer fits the target's exact-int
  window (`u8`/`i8 → f16`; `u8`/`u16`/`i8`/`i16 → f32`); otherwise
  it is a class-B rounding cast.
- **X → Str** — every scalar numeric (narrow widths and
  `U128`/`I128` included) plus `Bool` and `Json` render as a
  string via Display.
- **Bool ↔ numeric** — 1/0 mapping out, nonzero test in, both
  total and never panicking. Now covers **every** numeric width
  in both directions, including `U128`/`I128`.
- **X → Bytes** — little-endian serialize for every
  scalar numeric (narrow + 128-bit included), Bool,
  and the `VecF32`/`VecI32` sources; always succeeds.
- **X → Json** — wraps as the corresponding
  `Json::Number` / `Json::Bool` / `Json::Array` (or
  a decimal string for `U128`/`I128`, which JSON
  numbers can't hold). Integer and Bool sources
  never panic; `VecI32` is in this class because
  `i32` is always representable. `F64→Json`,
  `F32→Json`, `F16→Json`, and `VecF32→Json` are
  class B because non-finite floats are not
  representable in standard JSON.
- **VecI32 → VecF32** — lossless cast of every
  element.

**Class B — can panic on input** (lossy, parseable,
or shape-checking):

- **Numeric narrowings + non-widening casts** —
  `U64→{U32, I64, I32, F32}`, `I64→{U64, U32, I32,
  F32}`, `F64→{U64, U32, I64, I32, F32}`, etc.
  Range-checked; panic on out-of-range. Float→int
  also panics on NaN/Inf. Narrow targets are
  reachable from the wide carriers
  (`{U64,U32,U16,I64,F64}→U8`,
  `{U64,U32,I64,F64}→U16`, the `I*→I8/I16` set,
  `{F64,F32,U64}→F16`); 128-bit narrows only as
  `U128→U64`, `I128→I64`, and the `U128↔I128` /
  `I64→U128` / `F64→{U128,I128}` casts.
- **Str → X parsers** — every scalar numeric
  (`Str→{Bool, U8…I128, F16…F64}`) plus
  `Str→{Bytes, Json, VecF32, VecI32}`. Trim +
  parse; panic on unparseable. Workload-param flow
  (YAML interpolation, comma-split iter-values)
  lives here.
- **Bytes → X parsers** — length-checked, little-
  endian decode into every scalar numeric (narrow +
  128-bit), `Bool`, `Str`, `Json`, `VecF32`,
  `VecI32`. Numeric targets require exactly
  `sizeof(N)` bytes; Vec targets require a multiple
  of `sizeof(element)`; panic on wrong length.
- **Json → X extractors** — shape-checked into every
  scalar numeric (narrow + 128-bit), `Bool`,
  `Bytes`, `VecF32`, `VecI32`. `Json::Number`
  expected for numerics, `Json::Bool` for Bool,
  `Json::Array` for Vec, `Json::String` (hex) for
  Bytes. Panic on mismatch.
- **`F64→Json`, `F32→Json`, `VecF32→Json`,
  `VecF32→Str`** — class B because
  `serde_json::Number::from_f64` rejects non-finite
  floats; the adapter panics with a useful
  diagnostic.
- **`VecF32→VecI32`** — round each element; panic
  on non-finite or out-of-range.

**Class · — not in either catalog.** The matrix is complete
(§3.3), so every `·` is an **intentional** exclusion:

- **Scalar ↔ vector** — `VecX→{numeric, Bool}` and
  `{numeric, Bool}→VecX` are both excluded because no
  single collection-to-scalar convention (or scalar-to-
  collection length) is natural (first? last? length?
  sum? mean?). When the
  boundary rejects this pair, `WriteError::TypeMismatch`
  appends a hint pointing at the explicit helpers:
  `vec_len(v)` for the element count,
  `vec_first(v)` / `vec_last(v)` for an element,
  `vec_sum(v)` / `vec_mean(v)` for an aggregate.
- **`Ext` / `Handle`** — never in the auto-adapter
  catalog. `Ext` exposes typed access via
  `ReflectedValue::try_as_str` etc. at consume
  sites; `Handle` is downcast by the consumer node
  to the concrete type. The matrix above doesn't
  list these rows / columns.

### 3.1 Bytes conventions

| Axis | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| Numeric ↔ Bytes | little-endian, exactly `sizeof(N)` bytes (panic on wrong length) |
| Bool ↔ Bytes | 1 byte (`0x01` / `0x00`) |
| Vec ↔ Bytes | little-endian element bytes; length must be a multiple of `sizeof(element)` |
| Bytes ↔ Str | lowercase hex (`data_encoding::HEXLOWER`) — roundtrip-lossless, unambiguous, JSON-safe |
| Bytes ↔ Json | `Json::String` holding the lowercase hex |

**Little-endian** matches native CPU layout
(x86_64, ARM64) and the binary protocols this
substrate adapts to (CQL `vector<float, N>`, Postgres
binary). Authors who need big-endian byte order use
explicit `pack_u64_be` / `unpack_u64_be` nodes
(not provided by polyfill).

**Lowercase hex** for Bytes ↔ Str round-trip avoids
the URL-safety question entirely and reads
unambiguously in logs. Compact base64 encoding is
available as an explicit `base64_encode` node when
size matters.

### 3.2 Str → Json convention: try-parse-or-error-wrap

`Str→Json` attempts `serde_json::from_str`. Well-
formed JSON parses through:

- `"{"a":1}"` → `Json::Object({"a": 1})`
- `"[1, 2, 3]"` → `Json::Array([1, 2, 3])`
- `"\"hello\""` → `Json::String("hello")`
- `"42"` → `Json::Number(42)`

Malformed JSON wraps in a structured error rather
than panicking, so the substrate never silently
loses the original content:

```json
{
  "error": "invalid JSON",
  "message": "expected value at line 1 column 1",
  "raw": "{bad json"
}
```

Workload authors who pull the resulting `Json`
downstream see the wrapped error and can branch on
its shape. This matches the substrate's general
posture of "fail loud with useful context, don't
panic when the upstream might be human-typed."

### 3.3 Completeness

The matrix is **complete**: every meaningful `(from, to)` pair has
an adapter, and the `adapter_catalog_invariants` test enforces
this (`every_meaningful_pair_has_an_adapter`) alongside the
widening invariant and re-derives the grid above so it can never
silently drift. Three properties hold:

- **Widening totality** — every lossless widening, canonical
  `int → f64`, and the full `Bool ↔ numeric` / `int → bool`
  families are class A.
- **Scalar block total** — the 14×14 scalar block is fully A/B:
  every narrowing, cross-sign cast, `float → int`, and
  `int → narrow-float` is a class-B boundary adapter (range-checked,
  panics on overflow / non-finite).
- **Vector lanes total** — all seven lanes inter-convert
  element-wise (widening lanes class A, narrowing/`float→int`
  class B), and each serialises to / parses from `Bytes` / `Json` /
  `Str`.

The bulk of these (~130 trivial transforms) are macro-generated in
`library/polyfill_complete.rs`; the hand-written cores stay in
`convert.rs` / `polyfill*.rs`.

The **only** `·` cells are **scalar ↔ vector**, and that is a
deliberate exclusion, not a gap: a scalar carries no canonical
vector length, and a vector no canonical scalar reduction. The
explicit reductions are named nodes — `vec_len(v)`,
`vec_first(v)` / `vec_last(v)`, `vec_sum(v)` / `vec_mean(v)` — and
`TypeMismatch` on a rejected `vec → scalar` pair points the author
at them.

## 4. Why the `auto_adapter` / `boundary_adapter` split

Intra-graph wire validation should be **strict**:
when an author writes `s := "LATENCY"; overscan := s << 2`
the substrate should reject it at compile time, not
auto-insert a parser that runtime-panics on
"LATENCY". The intra-graph catalog (`auto_adapter`)
therefore holds only **class A** adapters from §3 —
adapters whose `eval` is total over the input
domain.

The host boundary (`adapt_boundary_value`) needs
**permissive** healing: workload-param values arrive
as `Value::Str` (YAML interpolation, comma-split
iter-values) and need to coerce into typed slots
the workload author declared as `Bool`, `U64`,
`F64`, etc. The boundary catalog (`boundary_adapter`)
is a strict superset of `auto_adapter` plus every
**class B** adapter — narrowings, parsers, shape-
checking extractors, non-finite-float refusers. The
panic-on-input semantics is appropriate at the
boundary because the Str source IS data the host
explicitly fed in, and "parse or panic with a
useful diagnostic" matches user expectation.

`Value::satisfies_slot(slot_type)` is the bit-
stuffing equivalence helper the residual check
uses post-adapter: `Value::U64` storage is accepted
for the unsigned widths, `F16`, and (legacy, during
the honest-I64 migration) the signed widths;
`Value::I64` for `I64`/`I32`/`I16`/`I8` slots;
`Value::F64` for `F64`/`F32`/`F16`; and any
register-view word for any reg-view slot (the
free-bitcast rule — a `Reg128` under one `RegLanes`
view satisfies a slot declaring any other, §1.5).
This lets narrowing adapters that output the bit-
stuffed runtime form (e.g. `__u64_to_u32` produces
`Value::U64` with low 32 bits) pass validation for
the narrower slot type without a separate Value
variant per port type. The pre-adapter strict
check `value.port_type() == slot_type` keeps an
unadapted `Value::U64` from silently truncating
into a U32 slot — the adapter MUST run.

---

## 5. Explicit conversion nodes (outside the catalog)

Nodes that perform deliberately lossy, formatted, or
parameterized conversions are NOT in the auto_adapter
catalog. Users place them deliberately by name.
Defined in `polydat/src/library/convert.rs`:

| Node | Signature | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `f64_to_u64` | `(f64) → u64` | Truncating cast (`as u64`) |
| `round_to_u64` | `(f64) → u64` | Round half-up to nearest |
| `floor_to_u64` | `(f64) → u64` | Truncate down |
| `ceil_to_u64` | `(f64) → u64` | Round up |
| `discretize` | `(input, range, buckets) → u64` | Bin a continuous f64 into `buckets` equal-width buckets over `[0, range)`; clamps out-of-range |
| `format_u64` | `(u64, base) → str` | Hex / binary / decimal rendering with prefix |
| `format_f64` | `(f64, precision) → str` | Fixed-precision decimal |

The principle: **if the user has to choose a rounding
mode, a base, a precision, a base unit, or a
truncation policy, the node is explicit**. The
auto-adapter catalog only contains conversions where
there is no semantic choice (widening, to-string via
Display, Bool ↔ U64 as 1/0).

---

## 6. Boundary adapter application

Two call sites apply the catalog:

### 6.1 Assembler — intra-graph wire validation

`compile::assembly::resolve` walks every wire after
parse, compares the producer's output `PortType` to
the consumer's input `PortType`, and:

- Equal types → wire it through, no adapter.
- Mismatch with a catalog entry → insert the adapter
  node inline, rewriting the wire to route
  `producer → adapter → consumer`.
- Mismatch with no catalog entry → fail construction
  with `AssemblyError::TypeMismatch` carrying both
  port types and the offending wire path.

This runs once at kernel construction; the resulting
program has no remaining mismatches.

### 6.2 Boundary — `adapt_boundary_value`

`polydat/src/kernel/state.rs::adapt_boundary_value`
applies the catalog at runtime mismatches where the
assembler has no view — outer scope values
crossing into inner kernels via the `set:` /
`bindings:` lowering, host writes via
`Dataflow::set_wire_idx`, etc. The helper:

1. Compares incoming `Value`'s `port_type()` to the
   slot's declared `PortType`.
2. Equal → returns the value unchanged.
3. Mismatch → consults `boundary_adapter(from, to)`
   (which checks `auto_adapter` first, then the
   boundary-only Str→X parsers from §4), runs the
   adapter's `eval` against the value, and returns
   the result.
4. No catalog entry → returns the value unchanged
   with a one-line audit warning; the caller's
   `set_wire_idx` then detects the residual type
   mismatch and surfaces `WriteError::TypeMismatch`
   to the host (scope-init code in
   `nbrs-runtime/src/synthesis.rs::apply_scope_values`
   re-raises this as a `panic!`).

---

## 7. Wire-type fusion (open question)

A separate design question — orthogonal to the
catalog gap — that the `eh` case surfaces.

Today the DSL parser
(`polydat/src/dsl/parser.rs::parse_interpolated_string`)
turns every interpolated string literal into a
`printf` call:

| Source | Desugared |
| --- | --- |
| `"hello"`           | `Expr::StringLit("hello")` |
| `"hello {name}"`    | `printf("hello {}", name)` |
| `"{a}-{b}"`         | `printf("{}-{}", a, b)` |
| `"{eh}"`            | `printf("{}", eh)`  ← **always Str** |

The sole-placeholder case `"{eh}"` is
syntactically a string template, but semantically
the author's intent is "pass `eh` through" — they
want the typed value of `eh`, not a string-formatted
copy. The current behavior wraps it in `printf`,
which always produces `Str`, losing whatever type
`eh` had.

If the parser detected sole-placeholder templates
and desugared `"{X}"` (whole literal = one
placeholder) to `X` directly (preserving type), the
`eh` case would route a Bool through to the
`enable_hierarchy: Bool` slot with no adapter
needed.

**Fusion vs polyfill are complementary, not
alternatives**:

- Fusion fixes the sole-placeholder case at parse
  time (no Str ever produced; no adapter needed).
- The Str→X polyfill adapters fix the genuinely-Str
  case — comma-split iter-values, multi-placeholder
  templates, host-supplied strings — where the
  source is intrinsically textual.

Even with fusion, comma-split iter-values like
`eh_values: "false, true"` would still produce
`Str("false")` iter-values; the polyfill is what
heals them at the slot boundary. Fusion would
prevent the *unnecessary* Str detour when the source
is already typed.

Fusion is not implemented; the parser comment at
lines 655-664 of `dsl/parser.rs` documents the
current "every placeholder → printf" rule. Adding
fusion is one branch in `parse_interpolated_string`:
if `segments.len() == 1 && matches!(segments[0],
Segment::Placeholder(_))`, return the placeholder
expression directly instead of building the printf
call.
