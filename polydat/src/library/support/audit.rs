//! Cycle-time data-source audit log.
//!
//! Emits one structured line per significant data-source event so
//! the operator can spot mismatches between what
//! [`crate::library::vectors::do_dataset_prebuffer`] *covered* and
//! what cycle-time accessors *opened*. The typical failure mode
//! this catches: prebuffer reports success but readers still hit
//! HTTP per cycle, because the facets the workload reads aren't
//! in the active profile's manifest.
//!
//! Output is routed through [`set_log_fn`] when the caller (the
//! activity runner, the test harness, …) installs a sink. With no
//! sink installed, lines go to stderr — preserves visibility from
//! contexts that don't carry an `observer::log` plumbing path
//! (unit tests, the `dryrun=` paths).
