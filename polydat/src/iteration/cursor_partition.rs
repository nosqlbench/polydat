//! Cursor partition specs — SRD 71.
//!
//! Value types and a small spec language following the token
//! grammar `chunking [in window] [order]`:
//!
//! - [`PartitionSpec`] — the parsed-but-unresolved form of a
//!   `cursor=...` argument: a [`Chunking`] (Form 1 single
//!   sub-range, Form 2 delta list, or Form 3 pre-baked recipe,
//!   as typed [`Bound`]s), an optional `in start..end` window,
//!   and a [`PartitionOrder`].
//! - [`Partition`] — a single resolved partition with concrete
//!   absolute ordinals, computed by [`resolve`] from a
//!   `PartitionSpec` against a known base extent.
//!
//! The parser and resolution math live
//! here; the DSL `over` clause and cursor source factory
//! integration live in their own modules. The Polydat `Value`
//! integration rides on the existing [`Value::Ext`] /
//! [`ReflectedValue`] mechanism — see the impls below.
