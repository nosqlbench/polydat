//! [`ScopeKernel<M>`] — typed wrapper around [`crate::kernel::PolydatKernel`].
//!
//! Per SRD-67 §"Walled-off invariant", `ScopeKernel<M>` is the
//! typed surface; the underlying `PolydatKernel` stays public for
//! Phase 1 (legacy call sites still construct it directly), and
//! becomes `pub(crate)` in Phase 4 once the migration lands.
//!
//! The kernel exposes:
//! - [`Self::subcontext_builder`] — yields a typed
//!   [`super::SubcontextBuilder`] from an `Arc<Self>`. The single
//!   public entry point for child construction.
//! - [`Self::spawn`] — the single chokepoint where every
//!   cross-binding is resolved; takes a closed
//!   [`super::ScopeModule`] artifact, applies SRD-67's
//!   cross-binding rules, returns a typed child kernel and
//!   records the spawn under `name` in this kernel's registry.
//! - [`Self::release_child`] — drop a registry entry to allow
//!   re-spawn under the same name (for per-iteration
//!   re-traversal).

//   1. Root kernel built from source via `compile_polydat` (and family).
//   2. Subscope kernel materialized by a parent kernel via
//      [`PolydatKernel::materialize_subscope`] or
//      [`PolydatKernel::build_subscope_from_source`] — all methods on
//      `PolydatKernel` itself, parent-supervised, typed.
//
// External callers go through these PolydatKernel-controlled paths
// directly; no free-function bridges remain.

// `instance_program` is removed. The two sanctioned construction
// paths are:
//
//   1. Root kernel built from source via `compile_polydat` family.
//   2. Subscope kernel materialized by an existing parent
//      kernel via `PolydatKernel::materialize_subscope` or
//      `PolydatKernel::build_subscope_from_source`.
//
// Tests that need a kernel from pre-compiled program matter use
// `PolydatAssembler::compile()` (which returns a root kernel) directly.
