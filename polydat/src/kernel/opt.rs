//! `KernelOptLevel` — session-wide optimization knob for op-template
//! kernel synthesis.
//!
//! Today's closure-binding economy (Rule 5) drops input slots for
//! names nothing in the body references — magic externs `body` /
//! `count` / `ok` and result-binding LHSs whose values nothing
//! downstream reads get DCE'd at slot-allocation time. Runtime
//! writes to those names land on a kernel that has no slot for them
//! and silently no-op.
//!
//! That's fine in production: the workload didn't ask for the value,
//! we don't pay to track it. It's actively harmful for step-debug /
//! cycle-replay / "show me what the adapter actually wrote this
//! cycle even though nothing read it" inspection.
//!
//! `Diagnostic` mode relaxes the DCE: every magic extern referenced
//! or not is allocated, every result-binding LHS gets a kernel slot
//! whether or not anything reads it. The writes land, `wires.get`
//! answers, the step-debugger sees the real values. Compute path
//! unchanged — the extra slots have no eval cone hanging off them.
//!
//! The knob threads through [`crate::kernel::subcontext::CompileOptions`]
//! and is consulted at op-template synthesis. A host CLI exposes
//! it as `--kernel-opt=release|diagnostic` (default `release`).

/// Optimization level for op-template kernel synthesis.
///
/// `Release` is the production default — closure-binding economy
/// elides slots for names nothing references. `Diagnostic` keeps
/// every magic-extern and result-binding-LHS slot allocated so
/// step-debug / cycle-replay introspection can see the values the
/// runtime would otherwise drop.
///
/// Naming: matches the rustc convention (`opt-level=0..3`) but
/// collapsed to two semantically-distinct positions; there's no
/// useful middle ground between "DCE on" and "keep everything for
/// inspection."
