//! Scope coordinates — the formal Polydat-side model of the
//! iteration position a kernel occupies inside an enclosing
//! comprehension chain.
//!
//! ## Definition
//!
//! A **scope coordinate set** for a single scope is the
//! ordered name→value tuple of every iteration extern that
//! scope owns — i.e. variables the scope declared via
//! `extern <var>: <type>` and that aren't mirroring an outer
//! scope (`is_inherited` returns false in this scope's program).
//! The order is the declaration order from the comprehension's
//! source (preserved by `IndexMap`'s insertion semantics).
//!
//! A **scope coordinate path** is the leaf-first list of
//! coordinate sets, walking from the kernel's own scope up
//! through every enclosing comprehension scope. Workload-root
//! params (top-level `params:` in the document) don't
//! contribute — they're configuration, not iteration
//! coordinates.
//!
//! ## Invariant
//!
//! Every kernel that has been *initialised in its scope* —
//! either via [`super::PolydatKernel::materialize_wiring_from_outer`] (post-bind
//! the path is `[own] ++ outer.scope_coordinates()`), or as a
//! root scope (path is `[own]` if non-empty, else empty) —
//! has [`super::PolydatKernel::scope_coordinates`] populated. This
//! is treated as a structural invariant of the Polydat model, not
//! an optional add-on: the runtime contract is that any
//! consumer (presentation layer, inspector, future scope-aware
//! diagnostics) can call `scope_coordinates()` on an
//! initialised kernel and get the full path back without
//! needing to walk the scope tree itself.
//!
//! ## Use
//!
//! Presentation-layer consumers (the inline status line, TUI
//! phase rows, the inspector socket) render the path as
//! striated parens — `(leaf coords), (parent coords), …` —
//! so the operator can read the active iteration off each
//! enclosing scope at a glance. Without striation the
//! operator can't tell which `k=10` belongs to the inner
//! comprehension vs. an outer one with the same coord name
//! in a different shape.
//!
//! See SRD 18b §"Iteration variables as scope outputs" for
//! how comprehension scopes synthesise the `extern` slots
//! that this module classifies as coordinates.
