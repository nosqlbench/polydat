# Evaluation Model

The mechanism contract for Polydat evaluation: program/state split,
provenance-based invalidation, the two-lifecycle classification
(effectively-const vs dynamic), the const binding contract
(Plan A/B compile-time + scope-activation checks), the
non-deterministic node exclusion, input spaces,
externally-written ports, and the engine-level compilation
surface.

This doc extends axiom-level statements:
- [runtime_model.md §1 program/state split + §3-§4 provenance + invalidation + R1-R3](runtime_model.md)
- [composition_substrate.md L2 (effectively-const) + S4 (external-write inputs) + T1 (typed return)](composition_substrate.md)
- [grammar.md G2 (const lifecycle declared at syntax) + G5 (two-lifecycle classification)](grammar.md)
- [engines.md (compilation levels; engine selection)](engines.md)

The host-side FiberBuilder and cursor-driven evaluation
(activity-pump details, DataSource API) are documented host-side.

The Polydat evaluation model separates the immutable program
(shared) from mutable per-fiber state (private). This
enables lock-free concurrent evaluation across hundreds of
fibers.

## Program / State Split

```
GkProgram (Arc, immutable, shared)
  ├── nodes[]          — node instances
  ├── wiring[]         — input source tables
  ├── input_names[]    — input dimension names
  ├── output_map       — name → (node_idx, port_idx)
  └── ports             — external-write port definitions

GkState (per-fiber, mutable, private)
  ├── buffers[][]        — per-node output value slots
  ├── node_clean[]       — per-node cache validity (bool)
  ├── inputs[]           — current input values
  └── port_values[]      — external ports (persist across set_inputs)
```

`PolydatProgram` is created once at compilation time and shared via
`Arc` across all fibers. `PolydatState` is created per-fiber via
`program.create_state()`.

---

## Provenance-Based Invalidation

Each node has a compile-time **provenance bitmask**: bit i is set
if the node transitively depends on graph input i. On input
change, only nodes whose provenance overlaps the changed inputs
are invalidated. Nodes depending on unchanged inputs stay cached.

```
1. fiber.set_inputs(&[cycle])
   → compare each input old vs new
   → build changed_mask (only inputs that actually changed)
   → for each node: if (provenance & changed_mask) != 0 → dirty

2. state.pull(program, "user_id")
   → if node_clean[node] → return cached buffer
   → recursively evaluate dirty upstream nodes
   → gather inputs, evaluate, mark node_clean = true
   → return &buffers[node_idx][port_idx]
```

This replaces the previous generation counter model. Nodes that
don't depend on the changed input skip evaluation entirely —
no generation comparison, just a boolean check.

**Diamond optimization:** In a diamond-shaped DAG where only one
input branch changed, the unchanged branch stays cached. The
generation counter model re-evaluated everything.

**Memoization granularity:** Every node's output buffer is cached.
For diamond-shaped flows where intermediate nodes are never
directly referenced as outputs, this memoization
has no consumer — the intermediate values are computed, cached,
and then recomputed from scratch on the next input change
anyway. A more targeted approach would memoize only at output
nodes and nodes with multiple downstream consumers. See
[GK Language §Incremental Invalidation](language_spec.md#incremental-invalidation)
for the broader discussion of provenance-based invalidation.

## Two Evaluation Lifecycles

A Polydat node's *lifecycle* is the granularity at which it is
re-evaluated. Two are recognised:

| Lifecycle | When evaluated | Re-evaluated when… |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **effectively-const** | Once, for the duration of a scope activation. Two implementation paths: (a) **compile-fold** — evaluated during Polydat compilation and replaced with a leaf const node; (b) **scope-init pull** — evaluated once after `bind_outer_scope` populates iteration-variable externs, then frozen for the activation. The choice between (a) and (b) is decided by the compiler based on the wire chain; the author writes `const NAME := <expr>` in both cases. | Never within an activation. The enclosing comprehension advancing to its next iteration (polydat comprehension dispense per `polydat/docs/design/comprehension_forms.md` §9.5) triggers a fresh activation, which re-runs scope-init pull (compile-folded leaves are immutable across activations). |
| **dynamic** | Once per pull, on demand at execution time | Whenever a transitively dependent input changes (provenance-based invalidation). Includes per-cycle pulls *and* intra-stanza recomputation when external-write ports or `do_while`/`do_until` counters tick. |

The `const` modifier is the single author-facing surface for
effectively-const bindings. The previous `init` / `final`
keyword pair split the surface artificially: `final` advertised
"please compile-fold," `init` advertised "please scope-init
pull," but both meant the same thing semantically — materialise
once, freeze for the scope's lifetime. Authors don't need to
know which implementation path the compiler picked; the
guarantee is the same either way.

### Effectively-Const Nodes

A node is **effectively-const** at a given scope-init point if
it produces exactly one value for the entire activation of the
owning scope. The set is closed under upstream traversal: a node
whose every upstream wire reaches an effectively-const producer
is itself effectively-const.

| Producer | Effectively-const? | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Literal in source | Yes | Resolved at parse / compile. |
| Compile-const fold result | Yes | Already a leaf const node. |
| Workload param (`const` binding) | Yes | Bound once at workload-kernel init, never reassigned. |
| `for_each` / `for_combinations` iteration extern | Yes — *for the duration of one activation* | Rebound by `bind_outer_scope` on each iteration; held constant for every cycle within that iteration (iteration variables are scope outputs the host rebinds per iteration). |
| `do_while` / `do_until` counter | **No** | Dynamic — ticks within the scope's own evaluation; not stable for the activation. |
| Graph input (e.g. `cycle`) | **No** | Dynamic — changes every cycle. |
| External-write port | **No** | Dynamic — mutated by external writes between pulls. |
| Non-deterministic source (`counter`, `current_epoch_millis`, `elapsed_millis`, `thread_id`) | **No** | Excluded by construction even when wires would suggest otherwise. |

The iteration-extern entry is the load-bearing case the prior
"binary" model handled wrong. A leaf phase nested inside
`for_combinations [profile, table]` sees `profile` and `table`
as input slots; the data-flow analysis flagged any binding
downstream of those slots as dynamic and refused to fold it.
But `profile` is rebound exactly once per phase activation and
held fixed for every cycle — the same stability guarantee as a
folded literal. Treating iteration externs as effectively-const
is what permits `const prebuffered := dataset_prebuffer("{dataset}:{profile}")`
to be a legal const binding inside such a scope.

### Compile-Time Constant Folding

Compile-time fold is the compile-fold implementation path for
the effectively-const lifecycle. It runs once per `PolydatProgram`
build, before the program is wrapped in `Arc` and shared:

```
Phase 1: Classify each node by upstream wire chain
  - Graph input / external port / non-deterministic source
                                  → not effectively-const
  - NodeOutput whose source is not effectively-const
                                  → not effectively-const (propagates)
  - Wire to an iteration extern (for_each / for_combinations)
                                  → not effectively-const at *compile*
                                    time. Extern values are unknown
                                    until scope activation; folding is
                                    deferred to the scope-init pass.
  - Everything else               → effectively-const at compile time

Phase 2: Evaluate compile-const nodes with dummy inputs

Phase 3: Replace evaluated nodes with leaf const nodes
         (ConstU64, ConstF64, ConstStr, ConstHandle, …)
```

Type adapter nodes (`__u64_to_f64`, etc.) participate. A chain
like `ConstU64(42) → __u64_to_f64 → sin` folds to
`ConstF64(sin(42.0))` — the whole chain is evaluated once and
replaced with a single constant.

Folded constants are available via `kernel.get_constant(name)` for
activity config resolution (cycles, concurrency from dataset
metadata).

### Scope-Init Pull

The scope-init pull is the scope-init-pull implementation path
for the effectively-const lifecycle. It runs once per scope
activation, *after* `bind_outer_scope` has populated the
kernel's iteration-extern input slots and *before* any fiber
is created.

```
For each const-modifier output b in this scope's program:
  1. Pull b's name on the activation kernel's state. The standard
     pull walks back through b's subgraph, evaluating each upstream
     node against the populated externs and caching the result in
     the state's per-node buffer (clean flag set to true).
  2. Verify the resulting value is non-`None` (Plan B, below).

After every const output has been pulled, the executor wraps the
kernel in an `OpBuilder` that snapshots the
`(node_idx, port_idx, Value)` triples for those bindings as
`init_overrides`. Each fiber spawned from this `OpBuilder` seeds
the triples into its own state's buffers and marks the
corresponding nodes clean. A fiber's first dynamic pull of a
const binding reads the seeded buffer directly — the binding's
eval function does not re-fire, regardless of how many cycles
or fibers traverse it.
```

This is the runtime side of the const-binding contract: one
eval per scope activation, full stop, regardless of fiber
count.

Reference points in the code:
- `polydat::kernel::engines::GkState::seed_node_buffer` —
  primitive that writes a value into a node's buffer slot and
  marks it clean.
- `nbrs_runtime::synthesis::OpBuilder::init_overrides` — the
  per-activation snapshot that fiber state inherits.
- `polydat::kernel::polydatkernel::PolydatKernel::materialize_wiring_from_outer`
  Step 3 — the per-const-output pull + non-None verification,
  immediately after the extern-slot bind step.

---

## Const Binding Contract

`const <name> := <expr>` is the canonical surface for an
effectively-const binding: it asserts that `<expr>` evaluates
to a single value for the entire activation of the enclosing
scope. The compiler and runtime together enforce two checks:

### Compile-Time Check (Plan A)

During Polydat compilation, after wire resolution and topological
sort:

> For every binding declared `const`, every node in its upstream
> wire chain must be effectively-const (either compile-foldable
> or an iteration extern that materialise-wiring populates at
> scope activation).

If any upstream node is non-effectively-const — a graph input,
an external-write port, a `do_while`/`do_until` counter, a chain through
a non-deterministic source — compilation **fails** with a
diagnostic naming the const binding and the offending wire.
There is no soft fall-through to dynamic evaluation.

This check runs in the compile-time fold pass. Effectively-const
classification (above) and the const-binding check share the
same upstream walk; the const check simply demands the upstream
set be a subset of `{compile-foldable ∪ iteration externs}`.

### Scope-Activation Check (Plan B)

After scope-init evaluation runs (the scope is activated,
externs populated, the scope-init pull pass has stashed values),
the kernel verifies:

> Every binding declared `const` has produced a single concrete
> value and is materialized as a leaf const-like node (ConstU64,
> ConstF64, ConstStr, ConstHandle, etc.) or a populated buffer
> on its node-backed output — no `Value::None`, no deferred eval.

If any const binding fails to materialize — most commonly
because its value type is not foldable to a leaf node, or its
eval returned `Value::None`, or a panic was caught and the node
was left unfolded — this is a **hard runtime error** at scope
activation, before any cycles run. The phase fails to start;
the diagnostic names the binding, the residual node type, and
the eval result.

Plan A is the type-system-style check that runs at compile time
when iteration-extern values are unknown but the wire structure
is fully visible. Plan B is the construction-correctness check
that runs at scope activation when the values are known and the
fold pass has had its chance. Together they ensure: a const
binding either evaluates exactly once per scope activation, or
the workload refuses to run.

### Why Both Checks

Plan A alone catches structural errors at workload-author time
(no need to wait for runtime; failures travel with the source).
But it cannot catch runtime conditions — a remote facet that
returns 403, an opaque eval panic, a `Value::None` from an
otherwise-valid scope-init pull — because those depend on real
extern values.

Plan B alone is robust against runtime conditions but defers
clear structural errors (e.g. a const binding that wires through
a `cycle`-dependent node) to runtime, where the failure surface
is larger and the diagnostic less localized to the source line.

Both are cheap. Both run at most once per scope activation. The
combined check is the contract.

### Diagnostic Format

Both checks emit the same shape — `const binding '<name>'
violates the const contract: <reason>`. The reason names the
offending wire (Plan A) or the runtime failure mode (Plan B).
Plan B errors carry the executor's `polydat_context` prefix
identifying the phase / scope.

Plan A reasons (compile-time, from
`fold_init_constants_impl`):

- **`wire on node '<n>' reaches coordinate input '<name>'
  (dynamic; changes every cycle)`** — const binding wired to a
  graph input declared by `input ...: u64`.
- **`wire on node '<n>' reaches external-write port '<name>'
  (dynamic; mutated by external writes)`** — const binding
  wired to an `extern X: T = default` port (the polydat
  external-write surface; hosts use it for runtime injection
  patterns).
- **`wire on node '<n>' reaches non-deterministic source '<name>'
  (dynamic by construction)`** — `counter`, `current_epoch_millis`,
  `elapsed_millis`, `session_start_millis`, or `thread_id`.
- **`wire on node '<n>' reaches dynamic node '<upstream>'
  upstream`** — fallback when the chain is dynamic but the
  immediate seed isn't one of the patterns above (e.g. a chain
  through a `do_while` counter).

Plan B reasons (scope-activation, from
`PolydatKernel::materialize_wiring_from_outer` Step 3):

- **`scope-init pull returned Value::None`** — the eval function
  signaled a fatal failure (e.g. `dataset_prebuffer` couldn't
  resolve the source) and refused to produce a value.
- **`scope-init pull panicked: <message>`** — the eval function
  panicked; details captured via `catch_unwind`. The panic does
  *not* poison the fiber pool; the phase fails to start cleanly.

---

## Non-Deterministic Nodes

`counter`, `current_epoch_millis`, `elapsed_millis`, `thread_id`
are excluded from compile-fold *and* from effectively-const
classification regardless of their input wires. They are
inherently dynamic even when a static analysis would suggest
otherwise. A `const` binding that depends on one of these fails
the Plan A check.

---

## Input Spaces

Most workloads use a single `cycle` input. Multi-dimensional
inputs enable nested iteration:

```
input cycle: u64

// Mixed-radix decomposition: flat cycle → nested indices
row := mixed_radix(cycle, 1000, 0)     // cycle / 1000
col := mixed_radix(cycle, 1000, 1)     // cycle % 1000
```

The input space is defined inside GK, not in the activity
layer. This enables composition with other nodes and keeps the
executor simple (it just passes `[cycle]`).

---

## External-Write Ports

External values may be injected into a `PolydatState` via
port-typed input slots. Two persistence variants:

- **Volatile ports**: reset to defaults on `set_inputs()`.
  Used for slots whose value is meaningful only within a
  single per-pull evaluation.
- **Sticky ports**: persist across `set_inputs()` calls
  until explicitly reset. Used for slots whose value should
  remain visible across multiple cycles within a stanza.

Both variants share the same write API: an external producer
writes a typed value into a named slot; subsequent pulls
that traverse the slot observe the written value through the
standard port-read mechanism.

```
Producer writes to slot "user_name"
  → state.set_port_value("user_name", value)
  → port slot in GkState holds the value

Consumer pulls a binding that reads {user_name}
  → standard port-read from state → returns the value
```

Sticky ports persist across `set_inputs()` calls.
`reset_ports()` is called at well-defined boundaries (host-
determined; typically when a stanza or other host-level
scope ends) to prevent stale values from leaking into a new
context.

Hosts give external writes their own application-level
names (nbrs's *capture* uses sticky ports to flow op-result
values into subsequent ops, for example); the polydat
mechanism is generic external-port population.

## Compilation Levels

The compiled DAG can run at one of three execution levels
— P1 interpreter, P2 closures, P3 Cranelift JIT — selected
automatically per subgraph based on node eligibility and
projected payoff. Per-node costs, eligibility rules, the
auto-selection heuristic, and the JIT call-boundary
contract live in
[engines.md](engines.md) and [jit_boundary.md](jit_boundary.md).

This file covers what *evaluation* is —
program/state split, lifecycles, provenance — independent
of which engine runs it.
