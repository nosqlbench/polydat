//! Cursor-constructor sugar registry.
//!
//! A *cursor sugar* lets a node module (vectordata, future
//! tabular sources, etc.) recognize a non-standard `cursor x =
//! foo(...)` form and rewrite it into:
//!
//! 1. A synthetic constructor expression (typically `range(...)`)
//!    that the standard extent-resolution path can drive, and
//! 2. Zero or more auxiliary bindings to emit after the cursor's
//!    input ports are wired — typical examples are an
//!    init-time prebuffer call and per-field projection bindings
//!    (`<cursor>__vector := vector_at("ds:profile",
//!    <cursor>__ordinal)`).
//!
//! The core compiler stays agnostic: it walks the inventory of
//! registered handlers, picks the first match, and applies the
//! rewrite. Adding a new sugar form is a single
//! `inventory::submit!` plus a handler function — no compile.rs
//! change required.
