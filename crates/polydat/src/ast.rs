//! Core types for Polydat nodes: values, ports, metadata, and the evaluation trait.
//!
//! The Polydat type system has three layers:
//!
//! 1. **Runtime values** ([`Value`]) — the enum that flows through
//!    the DAG at evaluation time. Every buffer slot holds a `Value`.
//!
//! 2. **Port types** ([`PortType`]) — compile-time type tags on
//!    node input/output ports. The assembler validates that wiring
//!    connects compatible types and auto-inserts adapters when not.
//!
//! 3. **Slot types** ([`SlotType`]) — distinguishes wire inputs
//!    (cycle-time values) from constant parameters (baked at
//!    construction). The DSL compiler uses these to decide whether
//!    a literal in a function call is a wire promotion or a const arg.
//!
//! The [`PolydatNode`] trait is what every node function implements.
//! A node declares its port metadata via [`NodeMeta`] and evaluates
//! via `eval(&[Value], &mut [Value])`.
