//! [`PullConsumer`] — wrapper / dispenser registration shape.
//!
//! ## Cross-crate boundary
//!
//! The runtime fixture / pull-plan machinery (SRD-32) lives in
//! `nbrs-runtime`. This crate (`polydat`) cannot depend on
//! `nbrs-runtime` — the dependency runs the other way. The
//! [`PullConsumer`] trait below carries only the *intent*: a list
//! of names the consumer wants to pull at cycle time. The
//! activity-side `ScopeFixture::register_consumer` adapter walks
//! these names and seals them into a `PullPlan` against the
//! spawned kernel's program. SRD-32's pull-plan format and the
//! per-consumer contract stay as 32 specifies; only the
//! accumulator surface unifies under
//! [`crate::kernel::subcontext::SubcontextBuilder::register_pull`].
//!
//! Phase 2 (the synthesiser migration) is responsible for moving
//! `ScopeFixture` to consume the consumers stored on a spawned
//! [`crate::kernel::subcontext::ScopeKernel`].

/// Anything that wants to pull Polydat values at cycle time.
///
/// Implementors expose the names they intend to read; the spawn
/// path makes those names available on the spawned kernel for

/// kernel.
