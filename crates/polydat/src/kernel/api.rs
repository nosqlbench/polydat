//! Polydat context API — the public-facing surface of a Polydat context
//! (compiled program + per-fiber evaluation state, fused as
//! one thing for callers).
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! A "context" is the user's view of a Polydat Kernel. Internally it
//! splits into:
//!
//! - **Compiled context** — the program (immutable, shared
//!   across fibers via `Arc<PolydatProgram>`).
//! - **Context state** — the per-fiber evaluation state (input
//!   buffers, node output buffers, dirty flags). Each fiber has
//!   its own state instance; the program is shared.
//!
//! Externally there is one type ([`PolydatKernel`]) and three
//! traits that partition its surface:
//!
//! - [`Dataflow`] — write inputs / read wires. Four core
//!   methods: indexed `set_wire(idx, …)` / `get_wire(idx)` and
//!   named `set_wire(name, …)` / `get_wire(name)`. All other
//!   data accessors (memoized handles, plans, projections)
//!   should build on these.
//! - [`Metadata`] — read-only diagnostic and structural data
//!   about the context: input/output names and types, scope
//!   layering, Polydat graph matter, init-binding sets, scope
//!   coordinates. No data flow.
//! - [`Construction`] — the two sanctioned construction paths:
//!   root from source matter, and subscope built against this
//!   context with new Polydat matter.
//!
//! [`PolydatKernel`]: super::PolydatKernel
